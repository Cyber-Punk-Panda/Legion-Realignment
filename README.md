## ECONOMY
*One major issue with Legion and MLA together in shared armies is that they cannot build their metal on the same spot together. In the past, this would be problematic because Legion T1 Mass Extractor + MLA T2 Advanced Metal Extractor would generate 1 more metal per second than a pure Legion-only T1/T2 Mass setup or a pure MLA-only T1/T2 Mass setup.*

*These changes seek to amend that, and also to make balancing Legion across different types of maps easier.*

*There are a lot of ripple effects caused by this, and a good majority of the changes in this mod seek to address the effects this has on Legion's early-game economy.*

### Mass Extractor
- Metal Production: 8 -> 7
- Cost: 220 -> 170
- Can now be built on top of MLA Advanced Metal Extractor.

### Advanced Mass Extractor
- Metal Production: 14 -> 15
- Cost: 2200 -> 2000
- Can now be built on top of MLA Metal Extractor.

### (MLA) Metal Extractor
- Can now be built on top of Legion Advanced Mass Extractor.

### (MLA) Advanced Metal Extractor
- Can now be built on top of Legion Mass Extractor.

## FABRICATORS

### Fabrication Walker
*Most competitive non-naval openings revolve heavily around the usage of MLA Bot Fabricators or Legion Fabrication Walkers. In order to compensate for the changes with T1 metal, we'll be adjusting the Fabrication Walker so it's a bit faster (albeit still slower than its MLA counterpart), costs less, and has the same fabrication rates as its MLA counterpart.*

*We hope the cheaper cost of a Fabrication Walker will help allow Legion players to get combat units onto the field earlier.*

- Cost: 150 -> 135
- Metal Usage: 9 -> 8
- Energy Usage: 650 -> 600
- Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
- Health: 65 -> 50

### Armour Fabricator
*The MLA Fabrication Vehicle and Legion Armour Fabricator are much less commonly seen in openings. As a result, the speed of the Armour Fabricator is less important to the viability of Legion earlygame expansion.*

- Cost: 200 -> 185
- Metal Usage: 13 -> 11
- Energy Usage: 850 -> 700
- Build Range: 45 -> 55

### Fabrication Flyer
- Cost: 225 -> 210
- Metal Usage: 10 -> 9
- Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Fabrication Ship
*Due to the sensitive nature of naval openings and the fact that MLA naval fabricators are already excruciatingly slow, we decided that it was best for the Fabrication Ship to have the same statistics as its MLA counterpart for now.*

- Cost: 240 -> 200
- Metal Usage: 16 -> 14
- Energy Usage: 850 -> 800
- Movement Speed: 9 -> 10

### Advanced Fabrication Walker
*We decided to take a similar approach here to the approach we took with the T1 Armour Fabricator*

- Cost: 2000 -> 1800
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 2200 -> 1800
- Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
- Build Range: 45 -> 60
- Health: 150 -> 250

### Advanced Armour Fabricator
- Cost: 2250 -> 2025
- Metal Usage: 70 -> 60
- Energy Usage: 2750 -> 2250
- Movement Speed: 10 -> 11
- Build Range: 45 -> 60

### Advanced Fabrication Flyer
- Cost: 2400 -> 1950
- Metal Usage: 60 -> 54
- Energy Usage: 2500 -> 2250
- Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Advanced Fabrication Vessel
- Cost: 2700 -> 2400
- Metal Usage: 90 -> 80
- Movement Speed: 9 -> 10
- Health: 675 -> 600

##  FOUNDRIES
*Legion Foundries currently cost a bit more; their T1 Foundries specifically cost 10% more than MLA counterparts (without faster fabrication speed). This is particularly noticeable in T1. We've brought down Legion Foundry buildcosts to be in line with MLA. This will hopefully allow them to act more aggressively in the earlygame.*

*We've also had to adjust some Legion Foundry energy usage to bring them in line with MLA too.*

### Walker Foundry
*We've also adjusted the walk-off time on the Walker Foundry in order to make it more competitive against the Bot Factory in the very early game. This might have some unintended mid-game side-effects since the T1 Walker Foundry already scales nicely.*

*For reference, the MLA Bot Factory has a walk-off time of 3, and all other T1 Legion Foundries share walk-off times with their MLA equivalents.*

- Cost: 660 -> 600
- Energy Usage: 640 -> 675
- Walk-off Time: 4 -> 3.5

### Armour Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600
- Energy Usage: 640 -> 675

### Flyer Foundry
*The Flyer Foundry inexplicably already uses 675 energy per second, unlike its fellow T1 non-Naval Foundries. Legion is a well-polished mod.*
- Cost: 660 -> 600

### Ship Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600

### Advanced Walker Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Armour Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Flyer Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Ship Foundry
- Metal Usage: 65 -> 60
- Energy Usage: 1900 -> 1750

### Starcannon
*No factory in the game builds as fast as the Starcannon for its cost. For only 1700 metal, you get production comparable to a 4500-metal T2 factory.*

*Additionally, the Starcannon can be assisted by Starship Fabricators, which are extremely efficient. Therefore, we have dramatically increased their walk-off.*

- Metal Usage: 45 -> 35
- Cooldown: 4 -> 10

## DEFENSES
*Legion defensive structures are currently notorious for being difficult to deal with. We've shifted balance a bit in order to make turtling slightly weaker as Legion.*

### Jackal
*Legion's ability to expand is partially impacted by the high expense of its defensive structures. We've thus made the Jackal both cheaper and weaker to encourage a slightly more rapid expansion rate for Legion players.*

- Cost: 350 -> 300
- Health: 750 -> 500
- Fire Rate: 15 -> 12

### Scarab
- Cost: 500 -> 400
- Health: 2500 -> 1750
- Fire Rate: 1 -> 0.7


### Hive
- Health: 1000 -> 750
- Ammo capacity: 2800 -> 3000
- Ammo per shot: 1400 -> 1500
- Range: 180 -> 165
- Spawned Swarm:
  * Fire Rate: 5 -> 4

### Centurion
*The Centurion was inexplicably strictly better than the Anchor previously. The Centurion is now conditionally better or worse than the Anchor, and has identical performance on average.*
- Fire Rate: 4 -> 2

## ARMOUR

### Maul
*The Maul is a support unit that doesn't see quite as much usage as the MLA Inferno. The fact that it's the slowest unit in almost any army composition certainly doesn't help. This change will hopefully penalize players less for mixing a few Mauls into their Armour armies.*

- Speed: 8 -> 10

### Scorpion
*Ever since the Leveler has had its range buffed to 140, the Scorpion hasn't been able to compete with it anymore. We've buffed the Scorpion's single-target performance a bit to help it out a bit versus the Leveler.*

*On the other hand, the Scorpion is also notorious for excessive scaling due to its high splash radius. We've reduced its splash radius a bit to compensate for the increased single target performance.*

- Health: 1650 -> 1700
- Speed: 8 -> 9
- Range: 140 -> 145
- Fire Rate: 0.4 -> 0.75
- Splash Radius: 15 -> 7.5
- Full Damage Splash Radius: 4 -> 3
- Splash damages allies: True -> False

### Deathmark

- Speed: 8 -> 9
- Range: 260 -> 255
- Damage: 1000 -> 300
- Fire Rate: 0.142 -> 0.155
- Targeting Priorities: Now prioritizes opposing artillery/tactical.

### Panzer

- Main Weapon Range: 180 -> 240

### Havoc
*The Havoc was historically a Leveler-killing unit, but getting a Havoc into range in the world of 140-range Levelers is rough.*

- Cost: 750 -> 600

## WALKERS

### Peacekeeper
- Movement Speed: 15 -> 16
- Health: 150 -> 135
- Damage: 19.5 -> 20
- Fire Rate: 1.2 -> 1.0

### Lancer
*The Lancer has always been problematic. It wants to be an anti-vehicle unit, but it has always been better at kiting Dox than fighting the Ant.*

*We want to restore the Lancer sniper fantasy, but balancing that is difficult. It seems like a lower yaw rate is sufficient to allow for this though.*
- Range: 75 -> 80
- Health: 120 -> 100
- Yaw Rate: 360 -> 105
- AT Commander modifier: 1.3 -> 1
- AT Structure modifier: 1.3 -> 1
- AT Vehicle modifier: 1.3 -> 1

### Patriot
- Movement Speed: 15 -> 14

### Purger
- Cost: 50 -> 60
- Health: 40 -> 10
- Jump Range: 40 -> 30
- Vision Radius: 50 -> 10
- Radar Radius: 0 -> 70
- Splash Radius: 15 -> 10
- Guard Radius: 50 -> 100

### Miniman
*We felt that the Miniman was unlikely to trigger its damage 
- Speed: 8 -> 10
- Damage: 500 -> 300
- Bomb Detonation Time: 2.5 -> 2.0
- AT Structure modifier: 3 -> 1

### Necromancer
*We wanted to encourage players to mix Necromancers into their main army composition. As a result, we removed the on-death explosion from the Necromancer.*

- Range: 180 -> 300
- Charge Rate: 35 -> 60
- Cost: 1400 -> 1200
- Vision: 100 -> 250

*Side note: the Necromancer used to be less efficient than a factory at producing Purgers; it used 60 metal per Purger while the factory used 50 metal per Purger. However, since we nerfed Purgers to cost 60 metal, Necromancers now have the same metal efficiency as a factory for Purger production!*

## FLYERS

### Marauder
*The Marauder is in an awkward position due to the fact that it serves the roles of both scout and harass unit. It seems to be undertuned, however.*
- Build Cost: 240 -> 180
- Damage: 16 -> 15
- Range: 60 -> 30
- Speed: 100 -> 85

### Lockheed
*As the result of a nerf to the MLA Kestrel, the Lockheed is now awkwardly strictly better than the Kestrel. We've applied the Kestrel nerfs to the Lockheed in addition to some other well-deserved adjustments.*

- Build Cost: 800 -> 1000
- Main Weapon:
  - Damage: 20 -> 15
- Rocket Weapon:
  - Damage: 250 -> 150

### Meteor
*The Meteor is currently extremely difficult to deal with without air superiority. We've reduced their range and health so they aren't quite as untouchable versus ground forces.*

- Range: 250 -> 190
- Health: 2000 -> 1000

## STARSHIPS

### Viper
*The Viper is somewhat weaker for its cost than the Avenger, in normal circumstances. We've attempted to address that to some degree with a slight cost decrease.*

- Cost: 350 -> 330
